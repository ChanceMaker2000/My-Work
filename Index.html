			</ul>
				<p>    Requiring a strong balance of strategy and reflexes, Tetris defined what it meant to be a puzzle game. It doesn't matter who you are; you've played Tetris — something not easily said about most games. Tetris was simple in its set up and masterful in its execution.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO BROS. 3</h2>
		<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61R6ZVBH7vL.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 450px;">

				<li><b>Released</b>: October 23, 1988</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    Introducing many features that went on to define the series, Super Mario Bros. 3 debuted flying, level-specific mechanics and different suits for Mario to wear. SMB3 also exhibited a generous respect for its players, rewarding them for taking the time to explore each level for secrets.</p>

		<h2>THE LEGEND OF ZELDA</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnCzd0UBUoU-n3sc4EufITNIk-0=/400x0/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6070295/1986.0.PNG" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: February 21, 1986</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    Introducing players to a world and characters they would live with for years to come, The Legend of Zelda was an incredible action role-playing game with tight controls and a great sense of exploration. That it came out so close to the original Super Mario Bros. makes us wonder just what was in the water in Kyoto.</p>

		<h2>DOOM</h2>
		<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OMYT7qbjL.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 400px">

				<li><b>Made by</b>: id Software</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: December 10, 1993</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    Doom made rockstars out of nerds. Led by video game luminaries John Romero and John Carmack, id's landmark first-person shooter birthed the massive popularity of the genre, spawned countless imitators and made the two Johns millionaires.</p>

		<h2>POKEMON RED AND BLUE</h2>

				<li><b>Made by</b>: Game Freak</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: February 27, 1996</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    Few games changed the course of history the way Pokemon Red and Blue did. The first games in the Pokemon series, Red and Blue turned the franchise into a global phenomenon, even before it transitioned into a multimedia titan with television shows, movies and a massive collectible card game.</p>

		<h2>MS. PAC-MAN</h2>

				<li><b>Made by</b>: Atari</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: 1981</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    Pac-Man normalized video games. Its addictive-yet-rewarding gameplay loop of eating Pac-Dots and running from the ghosts created a bonafide phenomenon, enticing people of all ages to take a stab at the arcade machines.</p>

		<h2>WORLD OF WARCRAFT</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQETWOd0XkDCefmb18BzecYCpRk=/0x0:370x208/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:370x208):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9764121/Wow.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Blizzard Entertainment</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 23, 2004</li>
			</ul>
				<p>    World of Warcraft set one of the highest watermarks in games, and Blizzard has continued to support it for more than 10 years. The game recently crossed the 100 million lifetime accounts line, thanks to constant expansions, updates and iterations. Praised for its massive open world, passionate community and deep quests, World of Warcraft is a masterclass in attention to detail that has kept players coming back.</p>

		<h2>MINECRAFT</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vaBNVd9rQ1VktSDfRYgn5oPP-Mc=/0x0:845x480/1200x800/filters:focal(356x173:490x307)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59710133/szML_eL4J2dLtZfMS3ccaAmOjWP8qVeR.0.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Mojang</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: May 17, 2009</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Minecraft never tells players "no." Deceptively simple looking, Minecraft's building mechanics and open-ended gameplay created one of the biggest fandoms in gaming by simply allowing players to use their imaginations.</p>

		<h2>STREET FIGHTER 2</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0MyTdg0r6xHnAzC8J0htQC-R48=/0x0:960x640/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:960x640):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9764123/SF2.JPG" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Capcom</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: February 1991</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   When you get people to compete, you bring in a lot of quarters. The game that kicked off the fighting game boom, Street Fighter 2 was a massive success at getting people back into arcades. And it went on to define the SNES library as well.</p>

		<h2>SUPER METROID</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZqYLe77V4rbIeMCOIptF8P_ZE1g=/0x0:534x345/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:534x345):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9764127/SM.png" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: March 19, 1994</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Arriving decades before the indie explosion, Super Metroid is still a common template for 2D and retro inspired indie releases housed under the "Metroidvania" subgenre. Its package included a beautiful game full of immense detail, massive open-ended levels and a meaningful arsenal of weapons and tools.</p>

		<h2>GRAND THEFT AUTO V</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/grand-theft-auto-5-premium-release-date-rumor.jpg.optimal.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Rockstar Games</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: September 17, 2013</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Grand Theft Auto 5 changed the world. The dawn of the modern Grand Theft Auto game, it showed how open worlds could work, with sandbox gameplay allowing players to do nearly anything they wanted. Its violence, too, intrigued and scared the wider world, bringing levels of media attention unseen before in games.</p>

		<h2>HALF-LIFE 2</h2>
		<img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/290930/header.jpg?t=1456194757" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Valve Corporation</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 16, 2004</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Praised for its revolutionary AI, gameplay and realistic physics, Half-Life 2 is the standard to which many first-person shooters are still compared — though few have managed to make the same impact.</p>

		<h2>SIMCITY</h2>
		<img src="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/eacom/en-us/migrated-images/2017/01/c-simcity-buildit-scbi-game-splash.jpg.adapt.crop191x100.1200w.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Maxis</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: March 5, 2013</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Inspired by creator Will Wright's interest in urban planning, SimCity established the city-building genre. Giving players the option to mark areas as commercial or residential, build transportation systems, adjust tax rates and more, SimCity revolutionized the simulation genre with its amount of content and depth.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO 64</h2>
		<img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--p6dyjTEP--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/un83j9cb6o0ulhpbehwj.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: June 23, 1996</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Reinventing how running, jumping and action worked in three dimensions, Mario 64 was one of the first games to explore how 3D spaces could replicate what players loved in 2D. It also experimented with freedom of movement and open levels that later became staples of the genre.</p>

		<h2>PORTAL</h2>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9f/Portal_standalonebox.jpg/220px-Portal_standalonebox.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 400px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Valve Corporation</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: October 10, 2007</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   What Portal lacked in length it more than made up for in unique, experimental gameplay based. Portal's puzzles allowed players to experiment with the best — and coolest — ways to progress with their Companion Cubes.</p>

		<h2>THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST</h2>
		<img src="https://sinhalenadsense.info/img/004d0b580e9dcc1ff3443f2aaba12b9d.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 21, 1991</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   A return to the series' original top-down perspective, A Link to the Past's Hyrule was massive — especially for the time — featuring numerous dungeons and two overworlds. It was "the purest representation of the time-honored Zelda formula," according to GameSpot.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO BROS.</h2>
		<img src="http://carlospenanow.com/img/faeb1c82feb18314810915880413ffcb.png" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: September 13, 1985</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   To this day, Super Mario Bros. still plays like a world-class 2D platformer. Its success isn't limited to just genre, though. The game also helped pull the video game industry out of the calamitous 1980s crash.</p>

		<h2>METAL GEAR SOLID</h2>
		<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/metalgear/images/4/4f/Metal_Gear_Solid_Integral.png/revision/latest?cb=20091227203208" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Konami</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: September 3, 1998</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Metal Gear Solid gets credit for popularizing the stealth genre. Bringing the Metal Gear series into 3D, the game let players sneak around real environments, hiding from guards and hiding bodies. Using elaborate cutscenes and voice acting, Metal Gear Solid's cinematic presentation made its deep story of top-secret infiltration rival Hollywood blockbusters.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO WORLD</h2>
		<img src="https://www.retrogames.cz/games/245/SNES_00.gif" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 21, 1990</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   World let Mario find new items, it changed how he jumped and traversed levels and it introduced Yoshi. Utilizing the expanded size of the Super Nintendo, World was a much bigger game than earlier Marios, shipping with 96 total worlds.</p>

		<h2>DONKEY KONG</h2>
		<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U24OcmpZ6fA/hqdefault.jpg" style="width: 400px;height: 400px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: 1981</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Nintendo's first major success in North America and the first game designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, Donkey Kong broke ground as one of the earliest examples of what a platformer could be — and it introduced Mario.</p>

		<h2>RESIDENT EVIL 4</h2>
		<img src="https://images.g2a.com/newlayout/323x433/1x1x0/507af0a79dd5/5910da8f5bafe3607751bdd2" style="width: 300px;height: 300px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Capcom</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: January 11, 2005</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Resident Evil 4 was a new perspective on an old genre. A change-up on the Resident Evil formula, RE4 introduced more action to the long-running survival horror series, and placed the camera over protagonist Leon Kennedy's shoulder — which fixed the series' legacy control issues.</p>

		<h2>DIABLO 2</h2>
		<img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91oQ5qLqtQL._SY445_.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 450px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Blizzard Entertainment</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: June 29, 2000</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Diablo 2 was one of the fastest-selling PC games — which makes sense. Following the immensely popular Diablo, this sequel didn't change too much. With more addictive hacking and slashing, and more loot and cows, Diablo 2 became one of Blizzard's highest achievements by being the only thing it needed to be: more.</p>

		<h2>THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIME</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0151/1123/products/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d-nintendo-selects-462809.14.jpeg?v=1462767669" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 21, 1998
</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Ocarina of Time made the transition from 2D to 3D look like the easiest thing in the world. Everything you'd come to expect from a Zelda game was there, yet a host of new mechanics elevated the gameplay. Featuring the groundbreaking target-lock system and songs needing to be learned, Ocarina of Time stood out.</p>

		<h2>THE SIMS</h2>
		<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJ-RiQkLStvf9VGgK9ecJLCoXzvpC8teF6EZzVbQ5U5FE7Xmj8" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Maxis</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: February 4, 2000
</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   The Sims took decades of simulation game history and applied it to something everyone could understand: the human life. Free of all the complicated, obtuse angles of other simulators, The Sims' accessibility, diverse character creation and variety of daily activities made it one of the most successful games in the genre.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO KART</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XjhBrYbTLz_K3ujBXDOoCY6eQzw=/0x0:1024x576/1200x800/filters:focal(431x207:593x369)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54380533/NintendoSwitch_MarioKart8Deluxe_Presentation2017_scrn10.0.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: August 27, 1992</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Super Mario Kart is a great racing game. But it's a Nintendo racing game, and that distinction matters. A mix of Nintendo's trademark zaniness and a highly-competitive racer, Super Mario Kart became a staple of couch co-op games, proving who was the best behind the wheel with a well-placed banana peel.</p>

		<h2>MASS EFFECT 2</h2>
		<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQlZMjNUSxkWqNRQwAQyh0-4ASfRnM9FarHIu4sKjjE05ks3Lmq"  style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: BioWare</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: January 26, 2010</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Mass Effect 2 marked the pinnacle of the series' agency and consequences. Essentially putting you on a suicide mission, the series built upon its deep relationships by placing your favorite characters' lives in your hands. This gave decisions true weight.</p>

		<h2>HALF-LIFE</h2>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fa/Half-Life_Cover_Art.jpg/220px-Half-Life_Cover_Art.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 400px;">
			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Valve Corporation</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 19, 1998</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Half-Life was a bleak story about science gone wrong. Unlike a lot of games at the time of its release, Half-Life told its story completely in-game, free of cutscenes. This, mixed with the great world design, and the fact Freeman was voiceless, allowed players to slip into Half-Life's world, personally engaging with the story more than in other games.</p>

		<h2>TEAM FORTRESS 2</h2>
		<img src="https://i.neoseeker.com/n/3/tf2_logo.jpg" style="width: 400px;height: 250px;">

		<h2>FINAL FANTASY 7</h2>
		<img src="https://lorenz-martini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1fe9c4f77b4913a0f21eb3964619624c.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">

		<h2>THE ELDER SCROLLS 5: SKYRIM</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn-cf.gamivo.com/image_original.jpg?f=1351&n=52c3cd10-7850-11e7-8203-abacaa3272cd.jpg&h=98e852dae154f4122d375aa6e4b279d9" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">

				<li><b>Made by</b>: Bethesda Game Studios</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: November 11, 2011</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   With The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, the ends more than justified the means. Taking influence from decades of open-ended role-playing games, Skyrim set new standards with its sheer world size, quest depth and character options.</p>

		<h2>SPACE INVADERS</h2>

				<li><b>Released</b>: 1978</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Space Invaders is among the pantheon of great early arcade games that turned video games from toys into a full blown business. Space Invaders also helped move games away from realistic depictions and towards fantastical settings.</p>

		<h2>STAR WARS: KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC</h2>
		<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/Kotorbox.jpg/220px-Kotorbox.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 400px;">

				<li><b>Made by</b>: BioWare</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: July 15, 2003</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Knights of the Old Republic let players play on whatever side of the force they wanted, abandoning the staple light side of the movies. Taking place before the main trilogy of films, the game set the then-industry standard for how to handle a morality system in a game, balancing the experiences of both sides of the coin.</p>

		<h2>PORTAL 2</h2>
		<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmpV0W32V7GvTLk02V-ZJrYHP_E=/0x0:1920x1080/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1920x1080):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9764171/Portal_2.jpg" style="width: 300px;height: 200px;">

				<li><b>Made by</b>: Valve Corporation</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: April 18, 2011</li>

				<p>   The first Portal's uses of telekinesis and teleportation gave the puzzle genre an exciting twist. Portal 2's expanded mechanics felt like a fresh start. Adding ways to redirect lasers and options to accelerate player speed created countless approaches to objectives, further opening up the puzzles to dynamic solutions.</p>

				<p>   Largely similar to the first Doom, Doom 2's biggest enhancements came in the way of graphical upgrades and larger maps. However, Doom 2, unlike Doom, was sold in retail stores, putting the first-person game in more hands than the original had been. Doom 2, though not id's most influential game, played a big role in the explosion of first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>

		<h2>SUPER MARIO WORLD 2: YOSHI'S ISLAND</h2>

			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: August 5, 1995</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Yoshi's Island's beautiful, hand-drawn art style made it one of the best-looking games of the 16-bit generation. With Yoshi as a playable character, the game introduced numerous mechanics players hadn't seen before, such as a flutter jump and the ability to transform.</p>

		<h2>HALO 3</h2>

			</ul>
				<p>   When you buy a new Halo game, you can generally expect it to be more of the same, but bigger. And Halo 3 was pretty much that. That's not to undersell some of its key features, though. Its Forge map editor allowed players to create and play their own multiplayer maps — an awesome addition to one of the series' hallmark modes.</p>

		<h2>OVERWATCH</h2>

			</ul>
				<p>   Overwatch left a crater in its wake when it landed in the gaming scene. Full of heart, full of character and one of the best-playing first-person shooters in recent years thanks to a bevy of vastly different, finely-adjusted characters, Overwatch wasted no time changing the game industry at large.</p>

		<h2>MARIO KART 64</h2>

			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Nintendo</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: December 14, 1996</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   This is where all business is settled. One of the industry's best examples of local multiplayer, Mario Kart 64 brought the series into 3D for the first time and it is still a staple of get togethers for those who remember fondly playing it as kids.</p>

		<h2>SONIC THE HEDGEHOG</h2>

			<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
				<li><b>Made by</b>: Sega</li>
				<li><b>Released</b>: June 23, 1991</li>
			</ul>
				<p>   Sonic wasn't always a punchline. When the original Sonic The Hedgehog hit the market, it was like nothing players had seen before. It was fast. It was cool. It had attitude. Sega's answer to Mario quickly became a massive brand.</p>
